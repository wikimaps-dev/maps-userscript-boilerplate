# Maps UserScript Boilerplate

**Boilerplate for writing Commons UserScripts that takes advantage from the Warper API.**

This boilerplate contains code to:

1. always run you code on pages with the `Template:Map` within the `File` namespace.
2. retrieve existing map data from the Warper.
3. authenticating a user using Mediawiki OAuth.
4. importing a map to the Warper.
5. validating user tokens.

It should be inline documented but if you run into something please create a new issue.
